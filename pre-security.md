# Pre Security
## Main Learning Points
- [Offensive and Defensive Security](#introduction-to-cyber-security)
- [Basics of Networking and the Web](#networking-fundamentals)
- [Basics of Linux and Windows](#linux-fundamentals)

## Introduction to Cyber Security
### Offensive Security (Red Teams)
- Breaking into systems/exploiting bugs/finding loopholes.
- Understand Tactics and enhance system defences.
#### Example Hack
Using a terminal use Gobuster to find hidden directories and pages.
Example command:
```
gobuster -u [site] -w [wordlist file] dir
```
- `-u` states the website
- `-w` states the wordlist being used to find hidden pages
I can now use any hidden pages found on the site in the browser to find exploits.

### Defensive Security (Blue Teams)
- Preventive measures to reduce incidents
- Detecting incidents and Respdoning accordingly
#### Defensive Security Tasks
- Training and awareness
- Knowledge of systems and devices to document and protect
- Updating and patching to keep devices secure
- Setting up Firewalls, IPS (intrusion prevention systems) which blocks network traffic matching rules and atttack signatures.
- Logging and Monitoring devices to detect incidents

## Networking Fundamentals
### What is Networking?
A Network is any connected devices</br>
The internet is a massive network connecting small networks. A repository to store and share information.</br>
The first iteration was within ARPNET project in the late 60s. Funded by the US Defence Department.</br>
It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee (World Wide Web)</br>
Small networks are called Private Networks.</br>
Networks connecting private networks are public (the internet).</br>
#### Identifying Devices
There are two types of identification:
- IP Address (Internet Protocol)
- MAC Address (Media Access Control)
##### IP Addresses
Identifies a host on a network. Can be associated with another device and not change.</br>
They can change from one device to another but can't be active more than once, at the same time on the same network.</br>
They follow standards called protocols, forcing communication to be in the same language. Devices can have public or private IPs depending on where they are.</br>
A public IP identifies devices on the internet. A private IP identifies amongst other devices.</br>
Devices will have public and private IPs. Public IPs are given by the ISP (Internet Service Provider).</br>
Due to the amount of IP Addressed needed for the amount of devices being used in the world there are now versions:
- IPv4 - numbering systerm of 2^32 (4.29 billion)
- IPv6 - numbering system of 2^128(over 340 trillion)
An example IPv4:
```
192.168.1.2
```
- Octet #1 `192`
- Octet #2 `168`
- Octet #3 `1`
- Octet #4 `2`
All these numbers can be from 0-255.</br>
An exmple IPv6:
```
2a00:22ca:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d
```
##### MAC Addresses
The MAC is assigned by the factory to a physical network interface on the motherboard.
It's a twelve character hexdecimal numer (base sixteen numbering system to represent numbers in computing). They are split into two and have separators (colons). The first 6 chracters represent the company and the last 6 is a unique number. Example:
```
a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d
```
These can be spoofed breaking poor security designs, assumes devices are trustworthy.</br>
Public places use MAC cotrol with guest or public wi-fi's. to exploit people for money in exchange for faster speeds.
